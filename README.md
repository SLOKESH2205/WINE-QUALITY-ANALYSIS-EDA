WINE QUALITY ANALYSIS – EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality Dataset to understand how different chemical properties affect wine quality ratings.

**PROJECT OBJECTIVES**
Load and explore red and white wine data
Handle missing values and cleanup
Perform statistical analysis and find trends
Study correlation between wine features and quality
Visualize data using different plots and charts

**DATASET INFORMATION**
Each wine sample includes:
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (target label from 0–10 scale)

**TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED**
Python
NumPy for numerical operations
Pandas for data handling and preprocessing
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

**ANALYSIS SUMMARY**
Alcohol percentage shows a strong positive relationship with quality.
Higher volatile acidity tends to decrease quality.
Most relationships between features and quality are moderate.
Quality distribution is skewed with more average-quality wines.

**VISUALIZATIONS INCLUDED**
Distribution plots for individual features
Boxplots for outlier detection
Correlation heatmap
Scatter and pair relationships between features
Bar chart comparison of wine quality scores
